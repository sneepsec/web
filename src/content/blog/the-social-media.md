Social media is always an indispensable part of our lives, from chatting and interacting with friends to scrolling through TikTok in our free time, posting Instagram stories, and checking Facebook notifications to see who has commented on our photos. It would be wonderful if we - English learners - could confidently talk about social media without being limited by vocabulary or typical phrases. In this article, we will provide exercises, listening tasks, and videos to help you gain more knowledge on this topic.

To expand your social media vocabulary, you can start by switching the language on your Facebook to English. Immediately, you will become familiar with basic terms such as comments, news feeds, friend requests, etc. You can also find a friend to exchange messages with in English every day. This is a very effective and intimate way to practice as the conversation material is drawn from your own life.

# How do you express yourself on social media?

This is a podcast with two people discussing their habits and the frequency of their own social media use.

Based on the podcast, you may want to practice by making sentences based on your social media habits. For example, this is how I would describe my own habits:
- Every morning when I wake up, I usually quickly pick up my phone and toss it into my bag to go to school.

- I like to leave casual comments and give heart reactions. I think it can bring joy to the person who posted, sometimes as a form of support or empathy towards them, helping them stay motivated to write. If I don't like it, I'll dwell on it.

- Accepting a friend request from someone I don't know.

- I'm a low-key person on Facebook, just observing and rarely interacting.

- We can lounge in bed all day swiping through the news feed. It's common to hold the phone even when going to the restroom.

- People can share memories, post mild complaints, or spread positive things on the timeline.

- ... to stay connected with friends or follow someone's day-to-day life.

- We have the opportunity to learn and gain a lot of useful information through Facebook.

- ... to promote communication for SEC (possibly a specific organization or group).

## Things on facebook:
- Bài đăng có nhiều tương tác: Highly engaging/popular/viral post
- Chủ đề nóng hổi, vấn đề thời sự: hot news, breaking news, topical issue,...
- Nội dung nhảm nhí, câu like: trashy/low-quality content, like-bait content
- Những câu chuyện truyền cảm hứng/cảm động/dễ thương: inspiring/motivational/touching/endearing/… stories

## The consequence after the usage process:
- Dùng FB để giết thời gian: … to pass the time
- Nghỉ ngơi sau (wind down/have a breather from…) sau khoảng thời gian dài công việc
- Bị xao nhãng: lose focus/get distracted
- Tiếp xúc (encounter/to be exposed to) với những nội dung xấu độc.

# Some special terms about social media

## Humblebrag

A humblebrag is when someone pretends to be modest or critical about themselves but is actually bragging or showing off. It's like pretending to be humble while subtly boasting. People often use this term as a hashtag on social media like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and even on Quora

| Social media status updates are basically selfies, humblebrags, and rants

This is something I find to be very normal because everyone wants to be loved, everyone wants to express their self, and be recognized by others. When one achieves something and receives admiration and recognition from others, it will provide them with additional motivation to move forward.

## Nomophobia
The no-mobile phobia, in short, is the fear of being without a mobile phone. This is a term that was coined in 2010 by the UK Post Office. It is a fear of being without a mobile phone, or beyond mobile phone contact. It is a fear of being out of touch with the world, with your friends, with your family, with your work.

In this video, they talk about smartphone addiction and suggests some solutions from experts.

How does the overuse of social media begin?
- At first, I just want to look briefly at my feed.
- Then it starts to feel sluggish, in a daze and somehow I can't stop scrolling.
- I have no idea how much time has passed by.

- When I stop, I check the time, one, two, or three hours have gone by. I asked myself: “What the heck I have been doing the entire time?"
- It repeatedly happens, becoming an issue that I can't resolve.

# Free talk
You can practice with your partner by answering the following questions:
1. Which social media platforms do you use regularly?
2. Are there specific times of day when you are most active online?
3. How frequently do you post or share content on social media? What is the content mainly about?
4. Share a humblebrag about yourself (just for fun).
5. What are your own solutions to control your digital well-being habits and reduce addiction?
